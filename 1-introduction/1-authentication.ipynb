    "# Troubleshooting Authentication with DefaultAzureCredential\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "DefaultAzureCredential is the recommended way to handle authentication in Azure applications. It provides a streamlined authentication flow by trying multiple credential types in sequence until one succeeds. This notebook will help you troubleshoot common authentication issues and ensure proper setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding DefaultAzureCredential\n",
    "\n",
    "DefaultAzureCredential attempts authentication methods in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Environment Credentials\n",
    "2. Workload Identity (in Kubernetes)\n",
    "3. Managed Identity\n",
    "4. Azure CLI Credentials\n",
    "5. Azure PowerShell Credentials\n",
    "6. Visual Studio Code Credentials\n",
    "7. Interactive Browser Authentication (as fallback)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure you have the following installed:\n",
    "- Azure CLI\n",
    "- Azure Developer CLI (optional)\n",
    "- Python Virtual Environment or Conda (use `uv venv` or `conda create`)\n",
    "- Required role assignments (Azure AI Developer)\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook environment - kernel configured to use Python 3.8 or later\n"

    "## Common Issues and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Token Acquisition Failed**\n",
    "   - Verify Azure CLI login: `az login --tenant <tenant-id>`\n",
    "   - Check default subscription: `az account show`\n",
    "   - Ensure correct tenant: `az account set --subscription <subscription-id>`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Missing Role Assignments**\n",
    "   - Add Azure AI Developer role:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   az role assignment create --assignee \"user@domain.com\" \\\n",
    "       --role \"Azure AI Developer\" \\\n",
    "       --scope \"/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<resource-name>\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Environment Variable Issues**\n",
    "   - Verify environment variables are set correctly\n",
    "   - Check for typos in variable names\n",
    "   - Ensure no extra spaces in values\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Always use environment variables for service principal credentials\n",
    "2. Implement proper error handling and logging\n",
    "3. Use managed identities when deploying to Azure services\n",
    "4. Regularly rotate service principal secrets\n",
    "5. Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning roles\n",
